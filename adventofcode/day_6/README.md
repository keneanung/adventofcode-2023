# Problem description

The given problem can be represented as a function with the overall form of $l=tx-x^2$ where `t` is the time of the race and `l` is the distance the boat travels. So to solve any of the solutions, we have to calculate $l_{Race} < t_{Race} x-x^2$.

For the first example, this term holds true for the integer values of `2, 3, 4, 5`. This puzzle was solved manually by me.
